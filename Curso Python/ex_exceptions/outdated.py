#Implement a program that prompts the user for a date, anno Domini, in month-day-year order,
#formatted like 9/8/1636 or September 8, 1636. Then output that same date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
#If the userâ€™s input is not a valid date in either format, prompt the user again.
#Assume that every month has no more than 31 days; no need to validate whether a month has 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.
