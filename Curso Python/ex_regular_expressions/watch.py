#Implement a function called parse that expects a str of HTML as input, extracts any YouTube URL thatâ€™s the value of a src attribute of an iframe element therein,
#and returns its shorter, shareable youtu.be equivalent as a str. Expect that any such URL will be in one of the formats below. Assume that the value of src will be surrounded by double quotes.
#And assume that the input will contain no more than one such URL. If the input does not contain any such URL at all, return None.
