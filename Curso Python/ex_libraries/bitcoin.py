#Implement a program that:

#Expects the user to specify as a command-line argument the number of Bitcoins, n, that they would like to buy.
#If that argument cannot be converted to a float, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.
#Queries the API for the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index at https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json, which returns a JSON object, among whose nested keys is the current price of Bitcoin as a float.
#Be sure to catch any exceptions.
#Outputs the current cost of Bitcoins in USD to four decimal places, using , as a thousands separator.
